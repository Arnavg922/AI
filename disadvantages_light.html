<ul>
<li>Can cost a lot of money and time to build, rebuild, and repair. Robotic repair can occur to reduce time and humans needing to fix it, but that'll cost more money and resources.
<li><p>It's questionable: is it ethically and morally correct to have androids, human-like robots, or recreate intelligence, a gift of nature that shouldn't be recreated? This is a discussion about AI that's popular in the days.</p>
<li><p>Storage is expansive, but access and retrieval may not lead to connections in memory as well as humans could.
     <ul><li>They can learn and get better with tasks if coded to, but it's questionable as to if this can ever become as good as humans can do such.
         <li>They could never, or, at least, seemingly never with our technological perceptions, recieve creativity that humans have.</ul></p>
<li><p>Robots, with them replacing jobs, can lead to severe unemployment, unless if humans can fix the unemployment with jobs AI can't do or severly change the government to communism.</p>
<li><p>As seen partially with smartphones and other technology already, humans can become too dependent on AI and lose their mental capacities.</p>
<li><p>Machines can easily lead to destruction, if put in the wrong hands. That is, at least a fear of many humans.
    <ul><li>AI as robots can supercede humans, enslaving us.</ul></p></ul>
